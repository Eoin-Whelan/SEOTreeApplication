# SEOTreeApplication
Discrete Structures &amp; Algorithms assignment in which I applied my understand and learning of Binary Search Trees to create an approximation of an SEO engine.

Used a static list of string memory addresses that were linked to keyword nodes within a BST. Limitations were set on the project by lecturer to only allow a max of five URL associations per keyword alongside four keywords to a single URL.
